# Lab 6 - NoSQL Databases
Welcome to Lab 6 of the DS-2002 course! This lab will take you through the fundamentals of the primary types of NoSQL Databases we have briefly covered in class:
- **Document**: Use MongoDB to explore Movie data to answer a few questions and practice querying.
- **Key-Value**: 
- **Wide-Column**
- **Time-Series**
- **Ledger**
- **Graph**: Complete the Neo4j fundamentals certification and add it to your LinkedIn!
- **Vector**

## Part 0. Setting Up and What to Submit
**Create**:
- Create a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) profile if you have not already.
- Create a new GitHub Gist, the URL of which is what will be submitted to Canvas for this lab. 

**Submit to Canvas:**
- URL to your GitHub Gist, which will contain the following information (please copy and paste the example below and then add the information to your gist as you go):

## Part 1. Document Databases using MongoDB:
#### MongoDB Atlas Free Tier:
- MongoDB Atlas offers a free tier that allows you to create a small cluster. While it's a cloud-hosted service, it's very easy to set up.   
- You can find many public datasets that can be easily imported into your free cluster.
- MongoDB also provides interactive tutorials and documentation with sample data.   
- This option is a very good choice, as it allows real world experience with a industry standard database.
- If you have not already done so, please watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DbZ2ii01ew&ab_channel=NealMagee) to set up your account.
MongoDB Playground:
This is a browser-based interactive shell where you can execute MongoDB queries and commands without setting up a local or cloud instance.   
While it might not always have extensive preloaded datasets, it allows for quick experimentation with commands and queries.
This is a great option for testing small queries and commands.
